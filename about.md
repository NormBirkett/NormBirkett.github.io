### What this blog is about

General topics:

I am interested in lots of other things, but this blog will confine itself to programming, especially in C++,
where my interests run toward the psychology of code and the trade-offs among programming paradigms.

A specific interest: The Gogetter Project

Over the past several years, I have discovered some coding techniques that I find interesting.
They appear to be very much off the beaten track, however.
When I've tried to explain them to people, it has proved difficult, probably because these ideas are too alien to our accustomed ways of thinking.
Or maybe they're just bad ideas!

My intention is to produce an implementation of these ideas in C++ at github, and to make it freely available.
That will require a good deal more clarification of the ideas.
I plan to use this blog for some of the necessary ruminations.

I am blessed to have two likely collaborators on this effort, and the blog will serve as a vehicle for communication and documentation of our efforts as well.

### Coming attractions

I'm planning to figure out how to use disqus so that comments will be possible here.
