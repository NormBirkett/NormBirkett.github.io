The central concern of this blog is dynamic polymorphism in C++, as it is now and and as it should be.
I will sometimes throw in other C++ topics.
And I can't guarantee that I'll never wander off topic. 
But that will be rare.

### How this blog came to be

At CppCon2018, I got inspired by conversations with Borislav Stanimirov, Jean-Louis Leroy, Erik Valkering and others.
We held a "birds of a feather" session early on Friday morning on "dynamic polymorphism" -- and to our surprise
around 25 people came! Apparently we had struck a nerve.

The first result of the BoF was the #dynamic_polymorphism Slack channel under Cpplang. 
If you find this blog at all interesting (and maybe even if you don't!), you will want to check that out.

This blog will be my place for writing about these topics. I'm sure I'll post links to it on the slack channel.

### Coming attractions

I'm planning to figure out how to use disqus so that comments will be possible here. But there's always the slack channel in the meantime.
