title: Notes on CppCon2018 Part 2 -- Testing, Quality and Code Improvement; Optimization and Efficiency; Functional Programming
---

## THEME #2: TESTING, QUALITY AND CODE IMPROVEMENT

* IMO, this area was underrepresented at the conference.
* On Monday, I was happy to learn about __Catch2__ from its author, Phil Nash of JetBrains. 
Looks like a great tool, and I am seriously considering moving from CppUTest to it.
* Contracts are coming to C++! There was a talk on Monday that discussed this feature in connection with generic programming,
but of course they will be useful more generally.
* Peter Sommerlad's talk on Wednesday morning(__Sane and Safe C++ Classes__) was chock full of valuable insights.
I was intrigued by his talk and by his speaker description, and plan to look into his methods and ideas.
* Kate Gregory's keynote session on simplicity was excellent, though it will be old hat to people who've studied 
books like __Clean Code__.
* Herb Sutter's annual talk on More Powerful and Simpler C++ was good, as well, though it was more at the level of
"how we're improving the C++ language so that you out there can write simpler code". Thought-provoking, as he always seems to be.
* Nico Josuttis on Initialization was highly entertaining, and also practical. Recommended, if only for the jollity in the
face of C++'s potential for obscurity.

## THEME #3: OPTIMIZATION AND EFFICIENCY

Closely related to the preceding theme, but usefully distinguished, I think.

* Tuesday's talk on RVO (Return-Value Optimization) was fascinating. This stuff is hard! I need to improve my knowledge of it.
* On Wednesday, the session on __How to Argue(ment)__ was excellent, and challenged some of my cherished views. Did it change 
them? That remains to be seen, but I will definitely rewatch this talk, and think about it.
* Best of all was "Everyday Efficiency" (Friday). Several immediately useful conclusions there, some of them quite surprising. 
High on my reviewing list.
* Much narrower, but representing some zealous space optimization, was the talk on Bloomberg's Datum. I quite enjoyed that.

## THEME #4: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Before this conference, I was aware that functional programming in C++ was a thing, but I had no sense of how big and 
valuable a thing it was.

* The highlight of this area for me was Ben Deane's talk on operator overloading, on Tuesday. Lots to study here.
* The same speaker did a session on Friday on "declarative style". Being in brain overload by then, I'm not sure I was able to
do it justice. Definite rewatch.

This topic overlaps quite a bit with theme #5 (q.v.)
