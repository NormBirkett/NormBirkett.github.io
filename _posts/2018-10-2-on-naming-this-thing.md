title: On names for the (Dynamic Polymorphism) Group, Effort, Movement, Conversation or Whatever it is
---
At Friday's BoF, there was some discussion of what name to give to the thing that we were launching.
No conclusions were reached, though I thought a few good principles or criteria were suggested.

So I thought about this on my way home. Good use for plane time. Katharine (who was also at the BoF) also had a number of ideas.

We thought of A LOT of names, and ruled most of them out on various grounds.

I'll list my favorites first, and then put the others in an appendix--only because one of them might trigger a thought process 
in someone reading this which will lead them to think of The Perfect Name.

I haven't got markdown to render in my blog posts yet, so I'll just list these with 'o' as a bulletoid. Let's see what happens!

o Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism, or D2P - this was obviously my favorite, though I don't think it's necessary The Ideal Phrase

o DP++ - my second favorite, as it suggests moving DP forward, and nicely captures our focus on C++

o Libertarian Polymorphism - Jean-Louis might like this; OTOH it's a mouthful, and 'LP' doesn't grab me

o Liberated Polymorphism - Katharine likes this one; I think it's good but not great; see above on 'LP'

o Proteus, or something with 'Protean' - Borislav and I tried to think of shape-shifters who were not villains, and agreed that
they are rare. I later thought of Proteus, a pre-Olympian god of the sea who was in the habit of changing his shape. 'Protean' has
positive connotations of flexibility. Perhaps something on this theme would work, but I certainly haven't nailed it yet!

o More Dynamic Polymorphism (MDP) - not bad, and not great; also Multiply Dynamic Polymorphism - which is worse

o The Mentor Group, or The Mentors - Mentor is a character mentioned early in Homer's Odyssey; Athena disguises herself as Mentor 
at a later point in the epic; so he was a character who was in fact two persons. Very highbrow and classical. But 'mentor' has acquired
a different set of meanings. And it seems too close to 'Dementor' (from Harry Potter; not a nice association).

o Mentes is another character in the Odyssey who is a real person and as whom Athena disguises herself at a key point. Probably
too obscure.

o Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism, abbreviated DDP - too close to Jean-Louis's DDD (Dogma Driven Development), which is too useful
to want to crowd it lexically; I liked 'D2P much better, but that of course is entirely subjective.

o The Dynamism Group - too vague, though it does have a certain, how shall we say, dynamism

o Really Dynamic Polymorphism (RDP) - OK, didn't grab me

o Dynamicker Polymorphism - in the sense of 'more dynamic'; we would have to explain it too much

o The Dynamiters, or the Dynamite Group - a bit too rad for my taste; plus we want to emphasize our positive program

I will also mention that we came up with various other phrases with D---- followed by Dynamic Polymorphism: Doubly, Double, Duly, etc.
I liked the version D2P, for Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism, better, so they all fell to the cutting-room floor.
