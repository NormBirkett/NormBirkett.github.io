title: On names for the (Dynamic Polymorphism) Group, Effort, Movement, Conversation or Whatever it is
---
At Friday's BoF, there was some discussion of what name to give to the thing that we were launching.
No conclusions were reached, though I thought a few good principles or criteria were suggested.

So I thought about this on my way home. Good use for plane time. Katharine (who was also at the BoF) also had a number of ideas.

We thought of A LOT of names, and ruled most of them out on various grounds.

I'll list my favorites first, and then put the others in an appendix--only because one of them might trigger a thought process 
in someone reading this which will lead them to think of The Perfect Name.

* __Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism__, or __D2P__ - this was obviously my favorite, though I don't think it's necessary The Ideal Phrase

* __DP++__ - my second favorite, as it suggests moving DP forward, and nicely captures our focus on C++

* __Libertarian Polymorphism__ - Jean-Louis might like this; OTOH it's a mouthful, and 'LP' doesn't grab me

* __Liberated Polymorphism__ - Katharine likes this one; I think it's good but not great; see above on 'LP'

* __Proteus__, or something with 'Protean' - Borislav and I tried to think of shape-shifters who were not villains, and agreed that
they are rare. I later thought of Proteus, a pre-Olympian god of the sea who was in the habit of changing his shape. 'Protean' has
positive connotations of flexibility. Perhaps something on this theme would work, but I certainly haven't nailed it yet!

* __More Dynamic Polymorphism (MDP)__ - not bad, and not great; also Multiply Dynamic Polymorphism - which is worse

* __The Mentor Group__, or __The Mentors__ - Mentor is a character mentioned early in Homer's Odyssey; Athena disguises herself as Mentor 
at a later point in the epic; so he was a character who was in fact two persons. Very highbrow and classical. But 'mentor' has acquired
a different set of meanings. And it seems too close to 'Dementor' (from Harry Potter; not a nice association).

* __Mentes__ is another character in the Odyssey who is a real person and as whom Athena disguises herself at a key point. Probably
too obscure. __UPDATE: This one has been growing on me.__

* __Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism__, abbreviated __DDP__ - too close to Jean-Louis's __DDD (Dogma Driven Development)__, which is too useful
to want to crowd it lexically; I liked 'D2P much better, but that of course is entirely subjective.

* __The Dynamism Group__ - too vague, though it does have a certain, how shall we say, dynamism

* __Really Dynamic Polymorphism (RDP)__ - OK, didn't grab me

* __Dynamicker Polymorphism__ - in the sense of 'more dynamic'; we would have to explain it too much

* __The Dynamiters__, or the __Dynamite Group__ - a bit too rad for my taste; plus we want to emphasize our positive program

I will also mention that we came up with various other phrases with D---- followed by Dynamic Polymorphism: Doubly, Double, Duly, etc.
I liked the version D2P, for Dynamic Dynamic Polymorphism, better, so they all fell to the cutting-room floor.
