A few things before you read about the Gogetter project itself--in no particular order:

1. I never set out to create anything like this. I just fell into it. There were some yicky problems in the codebase at work that I wanted to tackle, so I tackled them, and then I noticed that the result was interesting--to me, at least. Most features of Gogetter really just flowed out of the problems I was trying to solve. 

2. There are some programming problems where I am certain that Gogetter is extremely useful. Those problems are not particularly common, however. And I don't know to what extent Gogetter might be useful outside that smallish set of problems. I really don't know! Please don't take anything I say about Gogetter as suggesting that it's the Next Big Thing. I'm sure it isn't! It's just a tool that has proved useful on a couple of projects and that shows some potential for further usefulness. Beyond that, there is only uncertainty. Oh--and I find it interesting from a number of practical and theoretical points of view. Again: NOT the Next Big Thing.

3. I built and then rebuilt the prototype of Gogetter at my day job. All of that is proprietary. As often happens with prototypes, I've learned a great deal about how many things I did wrong. So Gogetter really won't bear much resemblance to the prototype. Which is why it can be open source.

4. The single hardest thing to decide about the project was its name. I have gone through more naming schemes for this thing in the last few years than you could ever imagine! In the end, I am grateful to my wife for having made the suggestion that morphed into 'Gogetter' and the rest of the names. (She suffered through numerous other naming phases, and listened patiently to my attempts to explain what did and did not work about each naming scheme. Huge contribution--and sacrifice!) I hope you like the names, but if not, well, too bad! I'm not changing them again!

5. This is a very hard project to describe, for a bunch of reasons. It has many interesting aspects, but some of them (by no means all!) are a bit abstract. I'm afraid that explaining it requires me to talk about matters that computer people aren't used to hearing about, or talking about them in ways that will seem unfamiliar or just weird. And the concepts themselves are not deep or intricate; everything looks pretty simple, in fact--though I would argue that that very simplicity is itself significant and interesting. Please bear with me. Try to get as far as the end of Part 2 of the Intro before you conclude that there's nothing here to interest you.

6. Thank you for your interest in Gogetter. It would help me immensely if you would give feedback via the commenting feature, especially of the "I don't get what you're saying about X" variety. (Though the occasional "this is great!" comment will also help with morale.)

So here we go...
