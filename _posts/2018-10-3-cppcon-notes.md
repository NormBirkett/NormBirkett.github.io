title: Notes on CppCon2018 Part 1: General Comments; Generic Programming
---

Why post this? Because it might be useful to someone else. And because no one else has to read it. 
And mostly because it will be useful to me as I work at digesting everything I saw and heard at the conference.

I'll arrange this by theme, with some general comments at the start.

## GENERAL COMMENTS

* What a great conference! It was my first technical conference of any kind, but I have to think it is a very good one.
The speakers ranged from good to brilliant. The material was uniformly interesting and valuable. 
And the content of each session corresponded well to the description of the session in the "course catalogue". 
That was refreshing.

* All the sessions will be posted in a few weeks. Meaning video. The slide decks, too, I believe. WHAT. A. RESOURCE.
The full list of sessions is at <https://cppcon.org/cppcon-2018-program/>. 
I know I'll be spending a long time rewatching, rereading, watching, and reading.
It often happened that there were two or three talks in the same slot that I really wanted to attend.
Now I get the chance.

* But the "confer" in the conference was also wonderful. 
One of the beauties of attending one of the talks was that you were in a big room with, say, 30 to 1300 people
who shared your interest in the topic. What a great way to meet people with whom you could discuss ideas!
And there were other magnets you could hang around that would attract those with common interests, such as the book table 
and posters.
This conference, like the C++ community as a whole, is really oriented toward grassroots fermentation.
A bunch of us discovered a common interest during the week, so on Friday we held an official "birds of a feather" (BoF) 
session and launched a slack channel that is already hosting discussion.
Our conversation during the week has now spawned an enduring process.

* Bellevue is a wonderful city to visit. Katharine came with me, and enjoyed seeing the sights. Especially
the Botanical Garden, which she visited four times. Granted, the weather was perfect, which the locals said
it usually isn't. Definitely the week to do the outdoor attractions! It turned out it was CppCon's last
year in Bellevue, though, which was bittersweet. Next year it will be in Aurora, Colorado, at a ginormous
conference/hotel complex that is still under construction. I plan to attend, if at all possible. But Katharine
and I will want to return to Bellevue sometime as well. It helps that we have multiple friends in Bellevue
itself, and a church that we would love to visit again not far from there.

## THEME #1: C++ GENERIC PROGRAMMING IS STILL ON THE MARCH

The accomplishments of generic programming in C++ are, frankly, astounding.
The STL. Boost. Countless open- and closed-source projects. Wow.
But Bjarne Stroustrup isn't finished making C++ the premier language in which to do generic programming.
If there's a better generic programming language out there, I haven't heard of it. 
But the great power of C++ is that the generic programming experts can do their thing, and then the rest of us can
use the tools they have given us. Again, the only word is Wow.

* Many sessions were devoted to Concepts. Bjarne on Monday (plenary). Several much more in-depth talks as well.
Can't wait to use concepts. I esp. recommend Andrew Sutton's session on Thursday afternoon, after Bjarne's more
high-level overview on Monday.

* It is time that people like me started making more use of the STL algorithms. And making our containers STL compliant, 
so they can be used by the algorithms. The best special effects of any session were in Jo Boccaro's "105 STL Algorithms
in One Hour". Brilliant use of graphics -- both the fun kind (yes, I bought his map :)) and the boring but effective kind
(illustrating the algos themselves). For me, I doubt a Broadway show could be more entertaining -- and definitely no way
near as useful.
