Before you read about Gogetter itself, you may want to know:

1. I never set out to create anything like this. I just fell into it. There were some yicky problems in the codebase at work that I wanted to tackle, so I tackled them. Then I noticed that the result was interesting. Most features of Gogetter really just flowed out of the problems I was trying to solve. 

2. There are some kinds of problems where I am certain that Gogetter is _very_ useful. Those problems aren't very common, however. I suspect Gogetter _might_ be useful one some other kinds of problems, but I don't know. I hope to find out. <!--more-->

3. Please don't take anything I say about Gogetter as suggesting that it's the Next Big Thing. _It isn't!_ It's just a tool that has been useful on a couple of projects and that shows potential for further usefulness. Beyond that, all is uncertainty. I do find Gogetter interesting from a number of practical and theoretical points of view. But I emphasize: _It's NOT the Next Big Thing, or a particularly big thing at all._ Just a tool of unknown usefulness.

3. I built and then rebuilt the prototype of Gogetter at my day job. The prototype is proprietary. As often happens with prototypes, I've learned how many things I got wrong. So Gogetter really won't bear much resemblance to the prototype -- which is the main reason I can make it open source.

4. The single hardest thing to decide about the project was its name. I have gone through more naming schemes for this thing than you could ever imagine! In the end, I am grateful to my wife for having made the suggestion that morphed into 'Gogetter' and the rest of the current naming scheme. She had suffered through discussions of many of the rejected names--itself a big contribution to the project. Anyway, I hope the names help more than they hide.

5. This is a very hard project to describe, for a bunch of reasons. It has many interesting aspects, but some of them (by no means all!) are a bit abstract. Plus, explaining it requires me to talk about matters that computer people aren't used to hearing about, or to talk about familiar matters in ways that will seem unfamiliar or just pointless. The concepts themselves are not deep or intricate; everything looks pretty simple, in fact. (I would argue that that very simplicity is itself significant and interesting.) Please bear with me. Try to get as far as the end of Part 3 of the Intro before you conclude that there's nothing here to interest you.

6. Thank you for your interest in Gogetter. It would help me immensely if you would give feedback via the commenting feature, especially of the "I don't get what you're saying about X" variety. (Though the occasional "this is great!" comment will also help with morale.)

So here we go...
